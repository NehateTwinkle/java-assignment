                                                              JAVA INTRODUCTION 



       ==>   Java is a popular programming languag.It was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in the year 1995,
             later acquired by Oracle Corporation.

      ==>    Java makes writing,copiling,and debugging programming easy.It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.

      ==>    Java is a class-based,object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

      ==>   A general-purpose programmind language made for devlopers to write once run anywhere that is compiled
             java code can run on any Java Virtual Machine.

      ==>   The syntex of Java is similar to c/c++.



                                                   <==   OOP Lenguage   ==>

       ==> Organizing the program in the terms of collection of objects is a way of object-oriented programming,
           each of which represents an instance of th class.


     ==> The four main concepts of Object Oriented programming are:

      1) Abstraction
      2)Encapsulation
      3)Inheritance
      4)polymorphism



     Class:-  It is a collection of data members and member functions.

      Object:- It is a real world entity.

     ==>  Execution of java programm

        1) public class 
        2) static block
        3) main method.

                                                   <== JAVA TERMINOLOGY ==>


           1) Java Virtual Machine(JVM).
           2) Bytecode in the Development process.
           3) Java Development Kit(JDK).
           4) Java Runtime Environment(JRE).
           5) Garbage Collector.
           6) Class path.
